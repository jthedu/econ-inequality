## Question 5f(i): Construct the outcome variables
```{r}
#import the dataset

  group_by(bin) %>%
  summarize(med_bin = median(dbirwt), mean_death1year = mean(death1year)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = med_bin, y = mean_death1year))

# my graph only has 7 points/bins...the paper has 10
